## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>=14)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/seongmini/sticky-markdown-note.git
cd sticky-markdown

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm start
```

### Building for Windows
```bash
# Generate installer and unpacked app in the `dist` folder
npm run build:win
```

> Note: the app isn't code-signed (no certificate configured), so `win.signAndEditExecutable` is set to `false` in `package.json`. This also sidesteps an electron-builder issue where it tries to fetch a macOS code-signing helper archive even for Windows-only builds -- extracting it needs the "create symbolic link" privilege, which fails on a non-elevated/non-admin shell with "A required privilege is not held by the client." The built exe still gets the correct icon (set during packaging, not by this step); only the exe's version-string metadata and signing are skipped.

### Building for macOS
```bash
# Generate DMG installer and app bundle in the `dist` folder
npm run build:mac
```

After building, you'll find:

- **Windows**: 
  - **Sticky Note Setup.exe** ─ the installer
  - **win-unpacked/** ─ the portable executable folder
- **macOS**:
  - **Sticky Markdown.dmg** ─ the installer
  - **mac/** ─ the app bundle

> **Note**: While the macOS version is built and should work, it has not been thoroughly tested on macOS systems. Please report any issues you encounter.

## Usage

1. **Launch** the app. The **Memo List** window shows all your notes.
2. Click **➕ New note** or press the shortcut to create a new note.
3. Select a note in the list to open it in its own window.
4. Edit text on the left; preview appears on the right.
5. Use search or shortcuts to navigate and manage notes.
6. Access **Settings** from the Memo List window to customize themes and shortcuts.

## Configuration

You can customize default font sizes and theme via a `.env` file in your user data path:

```dotenv
FONT_SIZE_DEFAULT=16
FONT_SIZE_MIN=8
FONT_SIZE_MAX=40
THEME=LIGHT # or dark
```
